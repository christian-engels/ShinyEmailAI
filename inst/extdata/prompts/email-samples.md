Many thanks for sending this along, Christian.  
Do you have uncropped versions of the images below? These are the ones that look most like a group of engaged participants. Unfortunately, photos of a speaker and a screen, especially against a sunny vista out a window, are notoriously less than great for featuring on the web, even though they do serve as a record of the event. I will need to make my own crop in 3√ó2 ratio to suit the template for the featured image; I can also possibly use a long thin one within the news piece.  
All the best  
Taylor

Hi Billie,

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you ‚Äì was organised a workshop that took place yesterday so I was very busy throughout the day.

Would tomorrow 2 pm work to go through the graphs and next steps?

Kind regards,  
Christian

Hi Christian,

Hope this email finds you well!

I was wondering if we could arrange a meeting, or if it would be possible to receive some guidance via email regarding what my next steps should be regarding the graphs I previously sent you.

Thanks,  
Billie
